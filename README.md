Trajectory data collection is a common task with many applications in our daily lives. Analyzing trajectory data enables service providers to enhance their services, which ultimately benefits users. However, directly collecting trajectory data may give rise to privacy-related issues that cannot be ignored. Local differential privacy (LDP), enables users to perturb their trajectories locally and provides a provable privacy guarantee. Existing approaches to private trajectory data collection in a local setting typically use relaxed versions of LDP, which cannot provide a strict privacy guarantee, or require some external knowledge that is impractical to obtain and update in a timely manner. 

This project aims to implement differential privacy for local machines. This way local machines have a way to encrypt their data and gain some privacy before sending them to the server side.
